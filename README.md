# hp_job_enum
originally from HP LaserJet SNMP User name enumeration tool v0.2 by Pinion Labs 050705

The tool uses the this so-called "feature" by HP-Jetdirect enabled printers to 
read job information about the stored jobs. It uses SNMP GET to read the specific OIDs.

I found this feature after a whopping 7 years still very useful and extended it's 
functionality to provide more information about the Jobs stored. See the advisory for
more information.
